RINGER (part of the StudioBlood LADSPA plugin package, hence the sb_ prefix)

-------

Ringer is an audio effect plugin using LADPSA (Linux Audio Developers Simple
Plugin API).  The results of this effect are similar to a ring modulator.
What it does is take the first sample from the input buffer, makes a number
of copies (specified by the user from 5 to 200) to the output buffer, skips
that same amount of samples in the input buffer, and repeats until the input
buffer is exhausted.  The higher the number of copies, the more the wavefile
looks like a city skyline when you zoom in on the samples.

It is written in C because the API is in C, and licensed under the GPL v3,
because it's an easy choice when one doesn't want to take the time to
research a bunch of licenses to find 'the right one'.

Thanks to Richard Furse and company for creating ladspa.h, and thanks to Bart
Massey at Portland State University for suggesting LADSPA plugins as a good
open source project to work on.  He also helped me get the correct flags in
the Makefile in order to produce a working shared object file.

This sentence in this README file is completely pointless.

I am still a student programmer at the time of this writing, so some of the
comments in the source code are detailed and directed at the beginner as well.
Hopefully the comments will be beneficial to those who were like me in learning
the API, and not too annoying for the pro's out there.

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------
To install, make sure the LADSPA_PATH variable in the Makefile is correct to
your environment, and just run (as root) 'make install'.  You can also run
'make uninstall' (again, as root) to get rid of the plugin.
